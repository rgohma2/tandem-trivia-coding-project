# tandem-trivia-coding-project

#Goal:

Your goal is to create an application that displays trivia questions with multiple-choice answers to select from.
Use creative license in terms of how you want us to see this game. At minimum, the player can view the question(s), the answer choices, the correct answer upon submission, and their score. It could be a user interface (UI), command-line-tool, etc. Feel free to use whatever framework or language you are comfortable with.

#Assumptions:

A round of trivia has 10 Questions
All questions are multiple-choice questions
Your score does not need to update in real time
Results can update on form submit, button click, or any interaction you choose
We will provide you with the trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers via a JSON file.

Acceptance Criteria:

 A user can view questions.
Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time. Questions should not repeat in a round.
A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers.
The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer A user can see the score they received at the end of the round.

#How to Run:

This app is very simple to run. It is hosted on github pages and can be accessed by web address at https://rgohma2.github.io/tandom-trivia-coding-project/.


#Defining Features:

Apart from meeting the requirements of the project, I also added a couple unique features....

There are two modes in which the trivia can be played, easy mode and hard mode. 
There is a progress bar that lets the user know how far along in the quiz they are and updates in real time after advancing to the next question.
The user can leave the quiz at any point during the quiz to return to the main menu.
The user can restart the game after finishing either mode and try again/try a different mode.


I had a lot of fun desiging this app, good luck and enjoy!
